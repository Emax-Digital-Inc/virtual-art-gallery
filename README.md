# virtual-art-gallery
# To accomplish the virtual art gallery system using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, you can break down the tasks as follows:

<!-- //Backend -->
# 1. Setting up the backend:
  #  - Install Node.js and MongoDB.
  #  - Create a new project directory and initialize it with Node.js using npm init.
  #  - Install required dependencies such as Express.js, MongoDB driver, etc.

# 2. Database setup:
  #  - Design the database schema to store artists, artworks, ratings, and purchases.
  #  - Create MongoDB collections for each entity (artists, artworks, ratings, purchases).
  #  - Establish a connection to the MongoDB database from your Node.js application.

# 3. User authentication:
  #  - Implement user authentication using a library like Passport.js or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  #  - Set up user registration and login routes using Express.js.
  #  - Store user information securely in the database.

# 4. Artist functionality:
  #  - Create routes and controllers for artists to upload their artwork.
  #  - Implement an image upload mechanism using a library like Multer.
  #  - Store artwork details in the database along with a unique QR code for each artwork.    (NOT DONE YET)

# 5. Customer functionality:
  #  - Create routes and controllers for customers to view and purchase artwork.
  #  - Implement search and filtering functionality to allow customers to find specific artworks.
  #  - Generate and display QR codes for each artwork to enable authentication.                  (NOT DONE YET)

# 6. Rating functionality:
  #  - Add routes and controllers for customers to rate artworks.
  #  - Store ratings in the database along with the associated artwork and customer information.

# 7. Purchase functionality:
  #  - Implement routes and controllers for customers to purchase artwork.
  #  - Integrate a payment gateway or provide options for offline payment.
  #  - Update the database to reflect the purchased artwork.

<!-- //Frontend -->
# 8. Frontend development:
  #  - Design and develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.
  #  - Create pages for artists to upload artwork, customers to view and purchase artwork, and for rating artworks.
  #  - Integrate APIs to communicate with the backend for data retrieval and submission.

# 9. Testing and debugging:
  #  - Test the system thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
  #  - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing.
  #  - Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

# 10. Deployment:
  #   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
  #   - Set up necessary configurations for the server and database.
  #   - Ensure the application is accessible to artists and customers.

# Remember to plan and design your system architecture carefully before starting development. 
# This breakdown provides a general guide, but you may need to adapt it based on your specific requirements and preferences.
